# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical mechanics, which deals with macroscopic objects, quantum mechanics reveals a world where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously and where measurement itself affects the system being measured.

## Historical Development

The development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized our understanding of the physical world. Key contributors included:

1. Max Planck (1900) - Discovered that energy is quantized
2. Albert Einstein (1905) - Explained the photoelectric effect
3. Niels Bohr (1913) - Proposed the quantum model of the atom
4. Louis de Broglie (1924) - Introduced wave-particle duality

## Key Concepts

The fundamental principles of quantum mechanics include:

1. Wave-particle duality
2. Quantum superposition
3. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
4. Quantum entanglement

## Mathematical Foundation

The mathematical description of quantum mechanics relies heavily on linear algebra and complex analysis. The state of a quantum system is described by a wave function \(\psi(x,t)\) that satisfies the Schr√∂dinger equation:

\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\psi(x,t) + V(x)\psi(x,t)
\]

where:
- \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant
- \(m\) is the mass of the particle
- \(V(x)\) is the potential energy

## Applications

Quantum mechanics has numerous practical applications:

- Quantum computing
- Laser technology
- Semiconductor devices
- Medical imaging (MRI)
- Quantum cryptography
