| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic Markdown | âœ… | Fully implemented |

## Footnotes

Markdown supports several footnote styles. Basic reference footnotes[^3] are the most common.

For technical content, footnotes can provide additional context without interrupting the flow[^4].

You can also use inline footnotes[^5].

Footnotes can be placed anywhere in your document, but are always rendered at the bottom[^6].

[^3]: This is a basic footnote. Simply add a reference and define it elsewhere in the document.

[^4]: When documenting technical concepts, footnotes can provide:
    - Additional background information
    - Links to related resources
    - Technical specifications
    
    Use indentation to include multiple paragraphs in a single footnote.

[^5]: An inline footnote is defined right where it's used, which is convenient for short explanations.

[^6]: Footnote definitions can be placed anywhere in the document. They will be collected and displayed together at the end, regardless of where they appear in the source.
