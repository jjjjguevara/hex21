# Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational approaches, leveraging principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain calculations far more efficiently than classical computers.

## Quantum Bits (Qubits)

Unlike classical bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, enabling quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously.

## Superposition and Entanglement

The two fundamental quantum properties that give quantum computers their power:

1. **Superposition**: Allows qubits to exist in multiple states at once
2. **Entanglement**: Creates correlations between qubits, even when physically separated

## Quantum Advantage

Quantum computers excel at specific problems including:
- Factoring large numbers (Shor's algorithm)
- Searching unsorted databases (Grover's algorithm)
- Simulating quantum systems
- Optimization problems
