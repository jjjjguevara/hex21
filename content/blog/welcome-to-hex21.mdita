# Welcome to Hex 21

We're excited to launch Hex 21, our new scientific content management system. This platform is designed to make scientific content publishing easier and more accessible than ever before.

## What's Special About Hex 21?

Our platform combines the power of DITA XML with modern web technologies to create a seamless publishing experience. Here are some key features:

- **LaTeX Support**: Write equations naturally using LaTeX syntax
- **Version Control**: Track changes and collaborate effectively
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Generate PDF, HTML, and more from a single source

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the platform!
