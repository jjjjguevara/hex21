# New Feature Announcement: LaTeX Support!

## What's new?
**LaTeX** support is now live, fulfilling our community's most-requested feature through comprehensive MathJax integration that delivers pixel-perfect mathematical notation. The system supports the full LaTeX syntax set, including advanced constructs like commutative diagrams, chemical equations, and physics notation, directly enhancing academic papers, engineering documentation, statistical analyses, and educational content.

## Benefits

This integration transforms the authoring experience for technical content creators:

- Real-time Preview: No more guesswork!
- Watch your equations render beautifully as you type within our editor.
- Effortless Copy-Paste: Seamlessly import equations from existing **LaTeX** documents or your preferred editor.
- Responsive Rendering: Your equations appear crisp and scale flawlessly across all devices, from desktops to mobile.
- Streamlined Workflow: Maintain your focus within our platform without needing external tools for equation rendering.

## But what is LaTeX?

LaTeX is the gold standard for typesetting documents, especially those rich in mathematical formulas and scientific notation. This powerful markup language offers precise control over the presentation of complex expressions, ensuring clarity and professionalism in technical communication. Think of it as an elegant system to transform text commands into beautifully rendered equations.

- A mathematical expression in **LaTeX** is comprised of the following elements:

|Symbols: <span style="color: #e76f51;">■</span>|Commands: <span style="color: #2a9d8f;">■</span>|Operators: <span style="color: #f4a261;">■</span>|
|---|---|---|
|**Structures: <span style="color: #264653;">■</span>**|**Delimiters: <span style="color: #6c5b7b;">■</span>**|**Fonts: <span style="color: #f1faee;">■</span>**|
|**Text: <span style="color: #d4a5a5;">■</span>**|**Spacing: <span style="color: #e9c46a;">■</span>**|**Braces: <span style="color: #1d3557;">■</span>**|


```latex
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{e^{-\pi x^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i^2}} \right) \, dx
$$
```

## LaTeX in action

Integrating equations is now effortless. Simply enclose your LaTeX code within `$` for inline equations or `$$` for block equations:

Inline Equation:

```latex
$E = mc^2$
```

Renders as: $E = mc^2$

Block Equation:

```latex
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{e^{-\pi x^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i^2}} \right) \, dx
$$
```

Renders as a distinct block for complex formulas:


$$\int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{e^{-\pi x^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i^2}} \right) \, dx$$
