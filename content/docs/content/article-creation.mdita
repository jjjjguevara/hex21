# Article Creation

Learn how to create well-structured scientific articles using Hex 21 CMS's DITA-based workflow.

## Article Structure

Each article consists of:

1. **Metadata** (YAML frontmatter)
2. **Content** (MDITA or XDITA format)
3. **Optional components** (images, equations, references)

## Creating a New Article

Create a new file with the `.mdita` extension:

This is the introduction to my groundbreaking research...

## Methods

Our methodology involved...

### Mathematical Model

Here's an equation:

$E = mc^2$

## Results

Our findings show...
```

## Adding LaTeX Equations

Use LaTeX syntax for equations:

- Inline equations: `$E = mc^2$`
- Display equations: `$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x$$`

## Including Images

Add images with DITA syntax:

```markdown
<image href="path/to/image.png" alt="Description">
  <title>Figure 1: Experiment Setup</title>
</image>
```

## References and Citations

Use DITA references for citations:

```markdown
<xref href="references.dita#smith2023">Smith et al. (2023)</xref>
```
